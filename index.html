<h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Initial Server Setup</h3>
<p>Begin by setting up your Ubuntu Server:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Update packages:
        <pre><code>sudo apt update</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Install Java for Jenkins:
        <pre><code>sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Install Docker and Docker Compose:
        <pre><code># Docker
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce -y

# Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Install Node.js, NPM, and Git:
        <pre><code>sudo apt install nodejs npm git -y</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate to your project directory where you intend to clone the repository. Once there, use the following command to clone the Docker-Distributed-System-with-Microservices-Architecture project from GitHub:
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/sabayneh1/docker-Distributed-System-with-Microservices-Architecture.git</code></pre>
        This step ensures that you have all the necessary files and configurations for your project readily available on your server.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Jenkins Installation and Configuration</h3>
<p>After preparing your Ubuntu server with the initial setup, proceed with the Jenkins installation and configuration as follows:</p>
  <p>Update your package manager:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo apt update</code></pre>
  <p>Install Java (Jenkins requires Java to run):</p>
  <pre><code>sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y</code></pre>
  <p>Add the Jenkins repository and key:</p>
  <pre><code>wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list</code></pre>
  <p>Install Jenkins:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y</code></pre>
  <p>Start Jenkins:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo systemctl start jenkins</code></pre>
  <p>Enable Jenkins to run at boot:</p>
  <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable jenkins</code></pre>
  <p>After completing these steps, Jenkins will be installed and running on your server. You can access it by navigating to http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080. The initial setup will guide you through unlocking Jenkins with an automatically generated admin password, located in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword, and through the installation of recommended plugins.</p>
  <p>Next, proceed to install the required Jenkins Plugins for Docker, SonarQube Scanner, and Pipeline support as previously outlined. This will ensure your Jenkins instance is ready to handle the CI/CD pipeline for your microservices architecture.</p>
  <p>Add Jenkins repository and install Jenkins. Access it at http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080 and complete the setup.</p>

<h2>Setting Up SonarQube for Project Analysis</h2>
<p>Begin by running SonarQube as a Docker container with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube</code></pre>
<p>Access SonarQube at <em>http://your_server_ip_or_domain:9000</em>. Log in using the default credentials:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Username: admin</li>
    <li>Password: admin</li>
</ul>
<p>After logging in, proceed to create a new project by navigating to "Administration" at the top right corner, then under the "Projects" section, select "Management." Click on the "+" icon, provide a unique project key and display name, and click "Create."</p>
<p>Next, generate an authentication token for your project, which will be used for integrating SonarQube with other tools like Jenkins. Go to "Administration" &gt; "Security" &gt; "Users." Select the admin user or create a new one, then navigate to the "Tokens" tab. Click on "Generate Tokens," provide a name for the token (e.g., Jenkins Token), and save the generated token for later use.</p>
<p>This setup enables you to not only analyze your project with SonarQube but also integrate analysis results into your CI/CD pipeline, enhancing code quality and security.</p>

  <h2>Install Required Plugins</h2>
  <p>To enhance your Jenkins setup with Docker, Docker Compose, NPM, Git, email notifications, and monitoring capabilities, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Go to Jenkins Dashboard: Navigate through Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins.</li>
      <li>Install Plugins: In the "Available" tab, search and install the following plugins if they're not already installed:
          <ul>
              <li>Docker Pipeline (for Docker support)</li>
              <li>CloudBees Docker Build and Publish (for Docker image handling)</li>
              <li>Pipeline: NPM (for NPM support)</li>
              <li>Git plugin (for Git support)</li>
              <li>Email Extension Plugin (for enhanced email notifications)</li>
              <li>Build Monitor View (for creating a monitoring dashboard)</li>
              <li>Any other plugins you find necessary for your setup (e.g., NodeJS plugin for managing Node versions).</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Configure Tools and Plugins</h2>
  <p>Docker and Docker Compose: Ensure Docker is installed on your Jenkins agent or server. For Docker Compose, you might need to install it separately on the agent.</p>
  <p>To use the downloaded plugin we need to go to Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration. and configure the the plugins</p>
  <p>Git: Configure Git under Global Tool Configuration if needed, ensuring Jenkins can access your repositories.</p>
  <p>Email Notifications: Configure email notifications under Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Extended E-mail Notification. Set SMTP server, user credentials, and other settings as required.</p>
  <p>Monitoring View: After installing the Build Monitor View plugin, create a new view by clicking on "+ New View" on the Jenkins dashboard. Select "Build Monitor View" and configure it to display your jobs' status.</p>

  <h2>Setting Up SonarQube Scanner</h2>
  <p>In addition to the SonarQube plugin installation, ensure the SonarQube Scanner is set up:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Navigate to Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration.</li>
      <li>Find the SonarQube Scanner section and configure it with the path to the SonarScanner or automatically install it.</li>
      <li>We will need to tell Jenkins where to find the SonarQube server, which can be done by following these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System.</li>
          <li>Scroll down to the "SonarQube servers" section.</li>
          <li>Click on "Add SonarQube" to add a new server.</li>
          <li>Provide a name (e.g., "SonarQube Server").</li>
        </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Creating the CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Additional Project Setup Steps</h4>
  <p>To establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, follow these organized steps, ensuring your project is built, tested, and deployed efficiently with necessary security measures.</p>

  <ol>
      <li><strong>Create a New Pipeline Job:</strong> Begin by selecting "Pipeline" in Jenkins and configure it with the provided Jenkinsfile code. This sets the foundation for your CI/CD pipeline.</li>
      <li><strong>Define Environment Variables:</strong> Specify essential environment variables such as GIT_CREDENTIAL_ID and DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIAL_ID. These variables are crucial for the pipeline's interaction with external services and repositories.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage Jenkins Credentials:</strong> Securely store all necessary credentials, including tokens for GitHub, DockerHub, and SonarQube. Navigate within Jenkins to <em>Manage Jenkins → Manage Credentials → System → Global credentials → Add Credentials</em>. Proper credential management prevents the need to hardcode sensitive information in your Jenkinsfile and secures access to your repositories and container registries.</li>
      <li><strong>Pipeline Stages:</strong> Detail the pipeline stages to outline the steps for checkout, build, test, deploy, and analyze phases. Structuring these stages clearly is key to a smooth CI/CD process.</li>
      <li><strong>Pipeline Script Enhancements:</strong> Enhance your Jenkinsfile to include tasks for Docker/Docker Compose, NPM installations, Git checkout, and post-build email notifications. Incorporating these steps ensures that your pipeline covers code compilation, containerization, and communication regarding build statuses.</li>
      <li><strong>Email Notification Configuration:</strong> Integrate email notifications within your Jenkinsfile to inform the team about the build status. This facilitates rapid response to any failures or issues and promotes effective collaboration and troubleshooting.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>By following these steps, you ensure a robust setup for continuous integration and delivery, facilitating automated builds, tests, and deployments, while maintaining the project with the highest security standards.</p>


  <h4>Accessing the Application</h4>
  <p>Access the services through the Nginx reverse proxy by navigating to your domain or public IP:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>/auth/ routes to the auth-service.</li>
    <li>/users/ routes to the user-service.</li>
    <li>/products/ routes to the product-service.</li>
  </ul>
